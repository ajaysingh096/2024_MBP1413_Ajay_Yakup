2024_MBP1413_Final_Report_Ajay_Yakup.pdf - Report

Final_2024_MB1314_Ajay_Yakup_MONAI_to_share.ipynb - Can be opened on Google colab for MONAI teaching
Monai_model.pth- finalized model for MONAI. This can be loaded to MONAI on google colab to run predictions on the UNET model trained. 
	
We demonstrate UNET and Mask R-CNN architectures' ability cell nuclei segmentation from a 2018 Data science bowl on keggle.
